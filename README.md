He this is Venkat Reddy, I just finished the RESTful API for /hello to respond with any JSON object data. Its as simple as it gets followed the instructions.

Just launch node.js index and the app will pick up the the rest from there. there is a http directory that contains the ssl certificates for https so please make sure that you have recreated or downloaded the git repository to run the app.

Thank you
